# hello-world
This is my first time using GitHub without any knowledge
I am Crystal, a student from University of Waterloo.
I've exposed to programming codes like Python, C++, SQL, HTML, CSS, Microsoft Visual Basic, C and Scheme.
I am a co-op student and I am interested in looking for a job involving coding, so that I can improve and learn new things.
